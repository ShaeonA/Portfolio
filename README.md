# Portfolio 
This assignment required me to code my Portfolio index.html using previous and acquired knowledge throughout these lessons, I then created a seperate file for my style CSS sheet in order to keep my code organized. Some features which I were told to include are a section with titled images of the developer's applications, and  a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports.
