            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> My Name is Shaeon Adams , I was born in Philadelphia Pennsylvania on 11/11/01.
                I lived there with my family until the age of 7 , we then relocated to Jacksonville, Florida.
                I have been in Jacksonville ever since, some interesting things about me are that I ran track in
                highschool,
                attended the junior olympics, and I also graduated a year early at the age of seventeen with a 3.7 gpa .
